# Redmine Project Alias

## Overview

This plugin allows creating a project "alias".  After creating an alias, the 
project can be accessed using the project alias instead of the project 
identifier.  It is a workaround for the inability to change a projects 
identifier after creation.

It is written for Redmine 2.5.x, other versions may or may not work.
